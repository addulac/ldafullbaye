In this paper, we have introduced a conjugate prior for the Dirichlet distribution in the exponential family, leading to a fully Bayesian treatment of the LDA model. We have in particular revisited the original inference method proposed in~\cite{blei_latent_2003}, and have developed a complete variational Bayes inference method for the LDA model with fully conjugate priors. The inference in that model generalises the standard EM type 2 procedure, while being similar in time complexity.

The experiments conducted on two document collections suggest that the conjugate LDA model obtained with an asymmetric prior on the document-topic distribution and a conjugate prior on the topic-word distribution compares favourably to the standard model for small collections, involving only few documents and topics. They also show that on such collections, full conjugacy on the word-topic distribution plays an important role.
