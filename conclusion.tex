In this paper, we have introduced a conjugate prior (called Boojum) for the Dirichlet distribution leading to a fully Bayesian treatment of the LDA model. We have in particular revisited the original inference method proposed in \cite{blei_latent_2003}, and have developed a complete variational Bayes inference method for LDA models with Boojum priors. The inference in such models generalizes the inference in standard LDA models, while being similar in time complexity with the standard EM type 2 procedure.

The experiments conducted on two standard collections suggest that the conjugate LDA model obtained with an asymmetric prior on the document-topic distribution and a Boojum prior on the word-topic distribution compares favorably to the standard model for small collections, {\it i.e.} collections involving few documents and topics. They also show that on such collections, the Boojum prior on the word-topic distribution plays an important role.
