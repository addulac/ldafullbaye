The LDA model \cite{blei_latent_2003} has been extended in many different ways to address different problems. Information about document authorship has, for example, been added to the model in \cite{Rosen_Zvi_2004}, whereas the integration of correlations between topics in the model has been explored in \cite{blei_correlated_2007}; more recently, \cite{Boyd_Graber_2009}, describes an extension to model multilingual unaligned collections.
